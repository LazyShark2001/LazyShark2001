## About Me
I’m Rivelle from Taiwan. Whether happy or sad, I always enjoy a cup of bubble tea 🧋

I’m here purely out of love and interest. Initially, I just wanted to show appreciation for my favorite open-source projects—yes, that’s it, no other reason. I mostly care about aesthetics (tweaking CSS, occasionally writing JavaScript to enhance both usability and design), and I also do some basic Traditional Chinese translations and i18n.

And no, I will never admit that I wrote this README just to showcase the nice banner I made.
