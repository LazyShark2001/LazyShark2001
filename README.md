## About Me
Hi, I’m LazyShark 🦈

Whether I’m happy or sad, an ice cream always makes things better. 🍦

I’m here simply out of curiosity and passion — just a place to keep the code I’ve spent time on, and the projects that truly caught my eye.This repository collects my explorations and little experiments in deep learning, computer vision, and object detection.If any of these projects inspire you, or even just make you smile, that’s already enough for me.

As for the real reason I wrote this introduction?
I’ll never admit it was just to show off my carefully chosen cover image. 😠
